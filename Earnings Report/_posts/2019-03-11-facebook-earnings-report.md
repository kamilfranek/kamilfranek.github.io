This chart visualizes Facebook's 2018 income statement. Facebook earns 99% of its revenues from advertising and despite a lot of regulatory and media pressure on the company during 2018 their financial result doesn't really show it. Its revenue grew from $40.7bn to $55.8bn (+37% growth) and its net income grew from $15.9bn to $22.1bn (+ 39% growth). Facebook did really well in 2018. If you want to know why, check my explanation of core trends below. 

## REVENUE

Facebook's revenue grew by 37% in 2018.  The number of users was still growing (9% year-on-year growth for Facebook users), but it was not the main driver of revenue growth. Majority of this growth was caused by an increase in average revenue per user.

Relative growth in revenue was quite evenly spread out between different regions. Since the majority of revenues comes from US&Canada and Europe, then in absolute terms, the majority of revenue growth also comes from  US&Canada and Europe. Nearly all of it was thanks to growth in revenue per user because active user growth in these regions was only around 1% to 2%. 

Average revenue per user in 2018 in the United States & Canada region was more than ten times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.

## COSTS and OPERATING INCOME

Good news is that revenue growth of 37% together with high starting operating income margin (50%) meant that Facebook grew in operating income by 21% even though its costs & expenses rose by 51%. 

The growth of the cost of revenues was driven mainly by an increase in operating expenses related to data centers and technical infrastructure and higher costs associated with partnership agreements (traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs)

Other expense items were growing mainly thanks to share-based compensation and growth in headcount. Headcount of Facebook was 35,587 at the end of 2018. An increase of a staggering 42% year-over-year.

## 2019 OUTLOOK

So in 2018 Facebook showed solid results. However, Facebook guidance is that revenue growth will decelerate in 2019. Not only that, but the company also said that they expect its expenses to continue to grow strongly in 2019 (by 40-50%).  As you can expect, revenue growth below 30% and expenses growth of 50% means none or quite small growth in operating income. 

**So What do you think, will Facebook positively surprise again in 2019?**
