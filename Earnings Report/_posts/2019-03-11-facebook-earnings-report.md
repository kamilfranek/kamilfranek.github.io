Facebook is one of the technology giants and is dominating the social media market with Facebook.com, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsUp.  The year 2018 wasn't the easiest one for Facebook since they were under a lot of regulatory and media pressure. However, Facebook financial results don't really show it and Facebook did really well in 2018.

## Key Highlight from Facebook's Annual Report

**Facebook is making money mainly from advertising which makes 99% of its revenue.** Facebook generated  $55.8bn (+37%) of annual revenues in 2018, and nearly all of it came from advertising and only "tiny" amount of $0.8bn (1% of total revenue) was from other sources, like net fee coming from Facebook Payments and also revenue from consumer hardware (Oculus and Portal). Mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 92% of total advertising revenue in 2018.

|Revenue						| 27.6  | 40.7	| 55.8	| *+37%*	| 
|Expenses 						| -15.2 | -20.5	| -30.9	| *+51%*	|

|`**Net income**`				    |**10.2**	|**15.9**	|**22.1**	| **+39%**|

Revenue grew by 37% compared to last year which is good news, but the company's revenue is just one piece of Facebook's net income. Above is a summary of Facebook's P&L that shows that even net income growth was strong (+39%) and Facebook made $22.1bn of annual net income in 2018. **Problem is that although bottom line result is great, not everything looks so rosy, because the one-off decrease in taxes is hiding quite a massive growth in expenses.**

## Revenue

Facebook's revenue grew by 37% in 2018 to $55.8 billion. Relative growth in revenue was quite evenly spread out between different regions with the exception of Asia-Pacific region where revenue grew by 48%. But the core question is what exactly is driving this growth. 


In general, Facebook can earn more revenue by:
- Increasing number of active users
- Increasing user monetization (revenue per user). This can be split further into price per add increase and increase in the number of ads per user

Growth of Facebook revenue in 2018 was driven by:
- **9% increase in active users** (Facebook made $24.96 per active user in 2018)
- **24% increase in revenue per user** 
	- 13% increase in price per add
	- 10% increase in adds delivered per user 

Wait a minute, isn't it in all the news that Facebook is plateauing and people are fed up with it and are closing their accounts?  Well, it wouldn't be the first nor the last time news outlet exaggerated, but although on overall numbers you can see that active users are growing, they are not growing in the same rate in all geographical regions that Facebook reports. 

In developed markets, active users grew around 2-3% only in 2018, which might be called plateauing, but thanks to higher growth in revenues per user compared to other regions (+34%) they still perform pretty well in revenue growth

In countries outside the US, Canada, and Europe, the number of active users grew by  12% in 2018 and revenues per user by 20%.

## Will Facebook Revenue Growth Decelerate in 2019?.

So what should you make of it? You can see a glass half full because you can see the big potential of monetization growth outside the US and Europe. On the other hand, you can see the glass half empty because Facebook you can frame see it as Facebook struggling with monetization outside developed markets and you don't believe it is going to get better.

Even if you are an optimist, thinks are not probably to change in 2019. That is also a message from Facebook's CFO David Wehner, who said it quite clearly during company's  Q4 earnings call.

> "We also expect that our revenue growth rates will
continue to decelerate sequentially throughout 2019 on a constant currency basis." 

## COSTS and OPERATING INCOME

Good news is that revenue growth of 37% together with high starting operating income margin (50%) meant that Facebook grew in operating income by 21% even though its costs & expenses rose by 51%. 

The growth of the cost of revenues was driven mainly by an increase in operating expenses related to data centers and technical infrastructure and higher costs associated with partnership agreements (traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs)

Other expense items were growing mainly thanks to share-based compensation and growth in headcount. Headcount of Facebook was 35,587 at the end of 2018. An increase of a staggering 42% year-over-year.

## 2019 OUTLOOK

So in 2018 Facebook showed solid results. However, Facebook guidance is that revenue growth will decelerate in 2019. Not only that, but the company also said that they expect its expenses to continue to grow strongly in 2019 (by 40-50%).  As you can expect, revenue growth below 30% and expenses growth of 50% means none or quite small growth in operating income. 

**So What do you think, will Facebook positively surprise again in 2019?**
