Facebook is one of the technology giants and is dominating the social media market with Facebook.com, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsUp.  The year 2018 wasn't the easiest one for Facebook since they were under a lot of regulatory and media pressure. However, Facebook financial results don't really show it and Facebook did really well in 2018.

## How Does Facebook Make Money: Key Highlights

**Facebook is making money mainly from advertising which makes 99% of its revenue.** Facebook generated  $55.8bn (+37%) of annual revenues in 2018. Nearly all of it came from advertising and only "tiny" amount of $0.8bn (1% of total revenue) was from other sources, like net fee coming from Facebook Payments and also revenue from consumer hardware (Oculus and Portal). **Mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 92% of total advertising revenue in 2018.**

|-------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|Revenue						| 27.6  | 40.7	| 55.8	| <span style="color:#009F6B">+37%</span>	| 
|Expenses 						| -15.2 | -20.5	| -30.9	| <span style="color:#d7141a">+51%</span>	| 
|**Operating Income**	        |**12.4**| **20.2**	| **24.9**| **+23%**|
|Other   						| 0.1  	| 0.4	| 0.4	|+15%	|
|Taxes    						| -2.3  | -4.7	| -3.2	|<span style="color:#009F6B">-30%</span>	|
|**Net income**				    |**10.2**	|**15.9**	|**22.1**	| **+39%**|

Revenue grew by 37% compared to last year which is good news, but the company's revenue is just one piece of Facebook's net income. Above is a summary of Facebook's P&L that shows that **net income growth was strong (+39%) and Facebook made $22.1bn of annual net income** in 2018. Problem is that although bottom line result is great, **not everything looks so rosy, because the one-off decrease in taxes is hiding quite a massive growth in expenses.**

Revenue growth of 37% together with high starting operating income margin (50%) meant that Facebook grew in operating income by 21% even though its costs & expenses rose by 51%.

## How Does Facebook Generate Revenue? 

**Facebook's revenue grew by 37% in 2018 to $55.8 billion.** Relative growth in revenue was quite evenly spread out between different regions with the exception of Asia-Pacific region where revenue grew by 48%. But the core question is what exactly is driving this growth. 

### How much revenue does Facebook generates in different geographic regions

|(in billions $) 				| 2016 	| 2017	| 2018 	| 2018 % Growth|
|-------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|US & Canada					| 13.4  | 19.1	| 25.7	| +35%	| 
|Europe 						| 6.8   | 10.1	| 13.6	| +35%  |
|Asia-Pacific   			    | 5  	| 7.9	| 11.7	| <span style="#009F6B">+48%</span> |
|Rest of the World    			| 2.4   | 3.5	| 4.7	| +34%	|
|**Worldwide**				    |**27.6**	|**40.7**	|**55.8**	| **+37%**|

In general, Facebook can earn more revenue by increasing number of active users or increasing user monetization (revenue per user). User monetization can be split further into increase in price per add and increase in the number of ads per user. So let's break it down using 2018 earnings numbers.

**Growth of Facebook revenue (+ 37%) in 2018 was driven by:**
- **9% increase in active users** 
- **24% increase in revenue per user** (Facebook made **$24.96** per active user in 2018)
	- **13% increase in price per add**
	- **10% increase in adds delivered per user** 

Wait a minute, isn't it in all the news that Facebook's number of users is plateauing becuase people are fed up with it and are closing their accounts?  Well, it wouldn't be the first nor the last time news outlets exaggerated something, but although on overall numbers you can see that active users are growing, they are not growing in the same rate in all geographical regions that Facebook reports. 

### Monthly Active Users (MAU) by Geographic Region (End of year)

Table below includes only monthly active users for facebook.com and Messenger. Users who have only used Instagram or WhatsUp are not included. 

|(in millions $)   	            | 2016 	| 2017	| 2018 	| 2018 % Growth|
|-------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|US & Canada					| 231   | 239	| 242	| +1%   |	
|Europe 						| 349   | 370	| 381	| +3%   |
|Asia-Pacific   			    | 673	| 828	| 947	| <span style="color:#009F6B">+14% </span>	|
|Rest of the World    			| 606   | 692	| 750	| <span style="color:#009F6B">+9%</span>	|
|**Worldwide**				    |**1,860**	|**2,129**	|**2,320**	| **+9%**|

In developed markets, active users grew only around 2-3% in 2018, which might be called plateauing, but thanks to higher growth in revenues per user compared to other regions (+34%) they still perform pretty well in revenue growth.

The strongest growth was in Asia-Pacific region, where key sources of growth are India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.In countries outside the US, Canada, and Europe, the number of active users grew by  12% in 2018 and revenues per user by 20%. 

### How Much Money Does Facebook Make Per User: Average Revenue per User by Geographic Region (ARPU).

| 								| 2016 	| 2017	| 2018 	| 2018 % Growth|
|-------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|US & Canada					| $62.23| $84.41	| $111.97| <span style="color:#009F6B">+33%</span> 	| 
|Europe 						| $19.41| $27.41	| $36.68	| <span style="color:#009F6B">+34%</span>  |
|Asia-Pacific   			    | $7.29 | $8.92	| $10.71	| +20%  |
|Rest of the World    			|  $4.66| $6.2	| $7.52	| +21%	|
|**Worldwide**				    |**$15.98** |**$20.21**	|**$24.96**	| **+24%**|

### Key highlights of Facebook Revenue Breakdown

- Revenue increased by 37% (+ $15.2bn) in 2018. This growth was balances across all regions, only Asia-Pacific overperformed, growing by 48%.
- Monthly active users (MAU) grew by 9% in 2018. There was minimal growth in Europe and the US (1% vs 3%) and quite a strong growth (+12%) in the rest of the world.
- Higher growth in revenue per user in the US, Canada & Europe compared to the rest of the word helped to offset slow growth in active users in these regions.
- The US & Europe make 70% of Revenue but only 27% of monthly active users.
- Average revenue per user in 2018 in the United States & Canada region was $112, which is more than 10x of revenue per user in Asia-Pacific region.

### Will Facebook Revenue Growth Decelerate in 2019?

So what should you make of it? You can see a glass half full because there might be the big potential of monetization growth outside the US and Europe. On the other hand, you can see the glass half empty because Facebook is struggling with monetization outside developed markets and you don't believe it is going to get better.

Even if you are an optimist, things are probably not going to change in 2019. That is also a message from Facebook's CFO David Wehner, who said it quite clearly during company's  Q4 earnings call.

> "We also expect that our revenue growth rates will
continue to decelerate sequentially throughout 2019 on a constant currency basis." 
>
>--David Wehner, CFO of Facebook

## How Does Facebook Spend Money?

To make money, you have to spend money and Facebook is really spending significantly more than last year. Total expenses increased by +51%. Two main reasons behind this growth are massive investments in data centers, technical infrastructure and massive growth of headcount.

### How much money and on what is Facebook spending

| 								| 2016 	| 2017	| 2018 	| 2018 % Growth|
|-------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|Cost of revenue				| -3.8  | -5.5	| -9.4	| <span style="color:red">+72% </span>  |	
|R&D expense					| -5.9   | -7.8	| -10.3	| +32%   |
|Marketing and sales expense    | -3.8	|-4.7	| -7.8	| <span style="color:red">+66% </span>	|
|General and admin. expense		| -1.7   | -2.5	| -3.5	| +37%	|
|**Total Expenses**				|**-15.2**	|**-20.5**	|**-30.9**	| **+51%**|

- **Cost of revenues** is an item with the highest annual growth and its increase was driven mainly by an increase in operating expenses related to **data centers, technical infrastructure and higher costs associated with partnership agreements** (traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs)

- **Other expense items** were growing mainly thanks to share-based compensation and **growth in headcount**. This growth was in line with revenue growth with the exception of marketing and sales expense that is growing quicker thanks to **increase in investments into marketing and community operations**. Without that, the growth would be in line with revenue growth.

Headcount of Facebook grew massively. Facebook had 35,587 employees at the end of 2018. An **increase of a staggering 42% in one year**

| 								| 2016 	| 2017	| 2018 	| 2018 % Growth|
|-------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|Emploees				        | 17,048| 25,105| 35,587| <span style="color:red">+42% </span>	|

### High expense growth will continue in 2019

Facebook will continue to heavily invest in its datacenters in 2018 and also continue growing its headcount. That was a management guidance during companys Q4 earnings call.

>On a full-year basis, we continue to expect 2019 total expenses will grow approximately 40-50%
compared to 2018.
> 
>Our 2019 capital expenditures outlook is unchanged at $18-$20 billion, driven primarily by our
continued large investment in building data centers.
>
>--David Wehner, CFO of Facebook

## 2019 Outlook

So in 2018 Facebook showed solid results. However, Facebook guidance is that revenue growth will decelerate in 2019. Not only that, but the company also said that they expect its expenses to continue to grow strongly in 2019 (by 40-50%).  As you can expect, revenue growth below 30% and expenses growth of 50% means none or quite small growth in operating income. 

**So What do you think, will Facebook positively surprise again in 2019?**
