Facebook is one of the technological giants and is dominating the social media market with Facebook.com, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsUp.  The year 2018 wasn't the easiest one for Facebook since they were under a lot of regulatory and media pressure. However, Facebook financial results don't really show it and Facebook did really well in 2018.

Facebook is making money in one core business and it's advertising which makes 99% of its revenue. Facebook generated  $55.8bn (+37%) of annual revenues in 2018, and only "tiny" amount of $0.8bn (1% of total revenue) is not coming from advertising and mostly consist from net fee coming from Facebook Payments and also revenue from consumer hardware like  Oculus or Portal. 

**Summarize Income Statement for Facebook, Inc.**

| 								| 2016 	| 2017	| 2018 	| 2018 % Growth|
|-------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|Revenue						| 27.6  | 40.7	| 55.8	| +37%	| 
|Expenses 						| -15.2 | -20.5	| -30.9	| +51%	| 
|**Income from operations**	    |**12.4**| **20.2**	| **24.9**	| +23%	|
|Other   						| 0.1  	| 0.4	| 0.4	| +15%	|
|Taxes    						| -2.3  | -4.7	| -3.2	| -30%	|
|**Net income**				    |**10.2**	|**15.9**	|**22.1**	| +39%	|

Revenue grew by 37% compared to last year which is good news, but the company's revenue is just one piece of Facebook's net income. Above is a summary of Facebook's P&L that shows that even net income growth was strong (+39%) and Facebook made $22.1bn of annual net income in 2018. Problem is that although bottom line result is great, not everything looks so rosy, because the one-off decrease in taxes is hiding quite a massive growth in expenses.

The following chart is a more detailed visualization of the facebook income statement and should help you understand the proportion between different items and highlight the main changes compared to the previous year. Below the chart, I will go through Facebook's results in a more detailed way. 

If you haven't encountered this chart before and are not familiar with it, I recommend going through my post explaining how and why I prefer to show income statement in this form.

## REVENUE

Facebook's revenue grew by 37% in 2018.  The number of users was still growing (9% year-on-year growth for Facebook users), but it was not the main driver of revenue growth. Majority of this growth was caused by an increase in average revenue per user.

Relative growth in revenue was quite evenly spread out between different regions. Since the majority of revenues comes from US&Canada and Europe, then in absolute terms, the majority of revenue growth also comes from  US&Canada and Europe. Nearly all of it was thanks to growth in revenue per user because active user growth in these regions was only around 1% to 2%. 

Average revenue per user in 2018 in the United States & Canada region was more than ten times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.

**Revenue by Geographic Region**
| 								| 2016 	| 2017	| 2018 	| 2018 % Growth|
|-------------------------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|US & Canada					| 13.4  | 19.1	| 25.7	| +35%	| 
|Europe 						| 6.8   | 10.1	| 13.6	| +35%  |
|Asia-Pacific   			    | 5  	| 7.9	| 11.7	| +48%	|
|Rest of the World    			| 2.4   | 3.5	| 4.7	| +34%	|
|**Worldwide**				    |**27.6**	|**40.7**	|**55.8**	| **+37%**|

## COSTS and OPERATING INCOME

Good news is that revenue growth of 37% together with high starting operating income margin (50%) meant that Facebook grew in operating income by 21% even though its costs & expenses rose by 51%. 

The growth of the cost of revenues was driven mainly by an increase in operating expenses related to data centers and technical infrastructure and higher costs associated with partnership agreements (traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs)

Other expense items were growing mainly thanks to share-based compensation and growth in headcount. Headcount of Facebook was 35,587 at the end of 2018. An increase of a staggering 42% year-over-year.

## 2019 OUTLOOK

So in 2018 Facebook showed solid results. However, Facebook guidance is that revenue growth will decelerate in 2019. Not only that, but the company also said that they expect its expenses to continue to grow strongly in 2019 (by 40-50%).  As you can expect, revenue growth below 30% and expenses growth of 50% means none or quite small growth in operating income. 

**So What do you think, will Facebook positively surprise again in 2019?**
