## Population Density By City
On the next map, we can also look at the same data in terms of population density. It is not surprising that the biggest cities are very densely populated but you can find also some other medium-sized towns with a high-density population. Moravia and North-South border with Germany are quite dense areas. On the other hand south of the Czech Republic below Prague is populated relatively sparsely, except few big cities.
