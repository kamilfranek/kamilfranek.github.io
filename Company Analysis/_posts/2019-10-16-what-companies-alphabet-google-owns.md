For understanding any company better, I think it is essential to understand also what subsidiary companies it owns and how they are organized.  In this article, I would like to share with you what I was able to learn from available public resources about Alphabet/Google subsidiaries. 

**Alphabet/Google owns hundreds of companies. The most prominent ones are:**
- **Google Inc.:** a core moneymaker
- **XXVI Holding Inc:** holding company
- **Alphabet Holdings LLC:** houses alphabet's investments (CapitalG and GV)
- **X Developments LLC:** "Moonshot" Factory
- **Other "Other Bets":** Waymo, Verily, Calico

**To make it easier to understand, I have organized and visualize everything in an organizational structure chart below.**

![The organizational structure of Alphabet Inc subsidiaries including Google LLC, XXVI Holdings, Waymo and X Development](/assets/images/alphabet_google_what_companies_it_owns_chart.png)


In the chart above, I had to condense Google Inc., the most significant part of Alphabet Inc, into just one box. However, a significant portion of nearly 400 hundred companies that are part of Alphabet Inc group is, in fact, subsidiaries of Google LLC. Also, there are many interesting things about Alphabet and Google companies that I was not able to put into this visual.

In the next chapters, I will go in detail not only through top-level companies that you see above, but I will also show you corporate organizational structure for sub-groups **Google LLC** and **Alphabet Holdings LLC**. You will also learn what ü•Éü•É "Double Irish" with ü•™ "Dutch Sandwich" is. 

For those of you, that want to go through list of all the other companies that did not make it to my selection, there is a list of them at the very end of this article. 

## What Companies Are Owned by Alphabet Inc: Top-Level Organizational Structure & Subsidiaries List

In the organizational structure chart above, you could see that Alphabet Inc. owns **XXVI Holdings, Inc.**, and this holding company owns all core parts of the Alphabet. The most important is, obviously, **Google LLC, which produces 99% of the Alphabets Inc. consolidated revenue.**

Before I jump into describing individual companies, let me give you insight into the level of detail Alphabet, Inc. management is currently providing about its subsidiaries. In their latest 2018 annual report (10-K). Alphabet Inc. disclosed that it owns four significant subsidiaries. They were:
- **Google LLC** (core profit maker)
- **XXVI Holdings Inc.**
- **Google Ireland Holdings** (Google LLC subsidiary, that realizes most international profits)
- **Alphabet Capital US LLC** (a company I currently know nothing about :-(, but thanks to Google we at least know that it is important) 

As you can see, Alphabet and most of the other big **US corporations do not disclose its full list of subsidiaries** but only the "significant" one. So I had to go to other public resources (SEC filling, company registries, court document, ..) to put together a list of companies and their relationships.

Someone might say that this detailed information is not needed when we have a consolidated financial statements where everything is taken into account. I will disagree. When I am analyzing a group of companies, I need to understand their organizational structure. Which legal entities are within the group, and how are they connected. Who owns who? Is there any cross-ownership? 

There are currently around 400 companies that I know are part of Alphabet Inc.  There probably are companies that I am not aware of, mainly if they do not have "Google" or "Alphabet" in their name and are registered in Delaware.

Below you can find a list of the companies shown in the chart for top-level Alphabet structure. Subsidiaries that did not make it to any of the organizational charts in this article are included in the ‚ÄúOther Alphabet Subsidiaries List‚Äù. Yout can find it at the end of this article.

| **XXVI Holdings, Inc** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Layer between Alphabet Inc. and individual companies of Alphabet. I was not able to find official reasons why they did that, and what benefits for the company (and shareholders) this additional layer has? Is this to lower some regulatory or disclosure requirements, tax reasons, or is this just technicality that was somehow needed to make the whole restructuring possible? The name of the company is referring to the Roman numeral of 26, the number of letters in the alphabet |

Google LLC has over 200 direct and indirect subsidiaries, and in the visualization above (and also list directly below), you will find only the most important ones. Companies that were not selected for this list are part of the long list at the end of this article.

### üìÉ List of Selected Google LLC Subsidiaries: 23 Companies


| Company&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Country |Description| 
|---------------|:----------------:|----------------|
| **DeepMind Technologies Limited** | ![GBR](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_gbr_mini.png) | Artificial intelligence/Machine Learning |
| **DoubleClick Holding Corp.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Online advertising company that Google acquired a decade ago. It recently announced that it is rebranding its advertising products, and it will no longer use DoubleClick brand. It might mean that DoubleClick related companies will be closed or merged with other companies. It might have already happened. |
| **Dropcam, Inc.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Home monitoring. Company is known for its Wi-Fi video streaming cameras. Was acquired by Nest soon after Nest was acquired by Google. This acquisition is often given as an example of how an acquisition can go wrong. |
| **Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd** | ![SGP](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_sgp_mini.png) | Singapore company that channels revenues (royalties) from Asia/Pacific region (through the Netherlands) to Ireland Holdings Unlimited. It has a similar purpose to Google Ireland Limited in Europe. |
| **Google Bermuda Limited** | ![BMU](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_bmu_mini.png) | Hard to say, where in the company hierarchy this sits. Might be the parent company of Google Bermuda Unlimited |
| **Google Dialer Inc.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Not sure exactly but connected to Google Fiber and Google Voice. |
| **Google Fiber Inc.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Internet Access Provider |
| **Google Fiber North America Inc.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Internet Access Provider |
| **Google International LLC** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Holding company for Google's subsidiaries in individual countries outside the US. |
| **Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Comp.** | ![IRL](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_irl_mini.png) | This is a very ‚Äúfamous‚Äù Google subsidiary that is incorporated in Ireland but managed and controlled in Bermuda. Google at least up to recently used this subsidiary as part of the ‚ÄúDouble Irish‚Äù with ‚ÄúDutch Sandwich‚Äù tax optimization scheme that is very common among large international companies. The company serves partially as a holding company for some international businesses but mainly as a holder of Google intellectual property that it further licensed to other Google companies for a fee. |
| **Google Ireland Limited** | ![IRL](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_irl_mini.png) | Google Services Provider for Europe and Switzerland. It books a lot of revenue, but makes very small profits, since it pays a lot to Google Netherlands BV for Google's intellectual property. Google Netherlands BV than channels this revenue to Google Ireland Unlimited that is incorporated in Ireland but domiciled in Bermuda. |
| **Google Netherlands Holdings B.V.** | ![NLD](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_nld_mini.png) | This company is used as a middle layer between Google Ireland Limited and Google Ireland Holdings. This allows Alphabet to pay very low taxes from its European operations thanks to a tax optimization scheme called ‚ÄúDouble Irish‚Äù with ‚ÄúDutch Sandwich.‚Äù This loophole was very popular among international technology companies and was already fixed for new arrangements.  Companies that were already using it, however, will be able to do so until 2020. |
| **Google North America Inc.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Provider of Google FI service (wireless network) |
| **Google Payment Corp.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Google's companies that handle money transfers and peer-to-peer transactions. In US payments are processed by Google Payment Corp. (GPC), which has the appropriate license for transmitting money and for peer-to-peer transactions in US. |
| **Google Payment Ireland Limited** | ![IRL](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_irl_mini.png) | Providing Google Payment Services for whole European Union (except UK) as a replacement for Google Payment UK. UK subsidiary will keep providing services for UK. |
| **Google Voice Inc.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Provider of Google Voice service. |
| **GU Holdings Inc.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Through this company, Google is building subsea cable infrastructure. For example, in 2019, they finished the connection between Los Angeles and Chile. |
| **Nest Labs (Europe) Limited** | ![IRL](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_irl_mini.png) | "virtual subsidiary" of Nest Labs. Owned by Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited, so not directly under Nest Labs |
| **Nest Labs Inc.** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Company flagship product and company's first offering before it was acquired by Google was Nest Learning Thermostat. Nest operated independently of Google from 2015 to 2018. However, in 2018, Nest was merged into Google's home-devices. (Still not sure if it was only organizational merger or also legal merger) |
| **Nest Labs Singapore Pte. Ltd.** | ![SGP](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_sgp_mini.png) | virtual "subsidiary" of Nest Labs. Owned by Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited. |
| **Verily Life Sciences LLC** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Research company developing tools that focus on health data and how they can help with timely decision-making and effective interventions. (formerly Google Live Sciences) |
| **Waze Mobile Ltd.** | ![ISR](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_isr_mini.png) | GPS¬†navigation software. Waze describes its app as a community-driven GPS navigation app, which is free to download and use. Waze is owned directly by Google LLC. |
| **YouTube, LLC** | ![USA](/assets/images/icons/country_flag_usa_mini.png) | Youtube is a very successful video sharing and hosting service that Google acquired in 2006. This acquisition became hugely successful for Google. But not everybody was persuaded that the acquisition made sense at the time. |

## What Companies Alphabet Holding LLC Owns: Organizational Structure & Subsidiaries List
![The visualized organizational structure of Alphabet Holdings' subsidiaries that includes CapitalG and GV subsidiaries and also Sidewalk Labs](/assets/images/alphabet_google_what_companies_alphabet_holdings_owns_chart.png)

**Alphabet Holding LLC** is a holding company that is a direct subsidiary of XXVI Holdings, Inc. It is **focused mainly on managing Google/Alphabet investments.** Both Alphabet investment managing firms **CapitalG and GV** are housed under this holding.  CapitalG and GV invest in other companies, but since those are usually small stakes below 50%, these companies are not part of Alphabet Group. If you want to know more about what companies do they invest in, both [CapitalG](https://capitalg.com/companies/){:target=" _blank"} and [GV](https://www.gv.com/portfolio/){:target=" _blank"} have a helpful list of their investments on their webpages.

## ‚ùì Why Does Alphabet Inc Exist? Why Was Google Transformed Into Alphabet?
Before 2015, there was no Alphabet, and Google Inc. was a publicly-traded company that you could directly own by buying its shares. All subsidiaries were subsidiaries to Google Inc. **In 2015 Google transformed into Alphabet, where Alphabet Inc became the top parent company** that was publicly traded. Google Inc. shareholders became overnight Alphabet Inc shareholders. 

In reality, many "Other Bets" businesses still stayed as subsidiaries of Google LLC even after the 2015 transformation, and it **was only recently when the whole transformation was finalized.  Finally, "Other Bets" companies were moved from outside Google LLC.**

**The reasons for this complex transformation** were described by Google management as an "**increase in transparency and oversight**," That would be achieved by putting larger projects at the same level as Goole LLC with their separate management, reporting directly to Alphabet Inc management.

I clearly see the benefits of why this was done and how it could help Google/Alphabet to run more efficiently. The problem is, that proclaimed **increase in transparency was only internal for Google management. Transparency for investors did not increase.** 

**Another reason** behind the transformation was obviously **limiting risk**. By separating Google into different companies, each one of them is independent of each other. If something bad happens in one company, the others would be protected from it.


## ü•Éü•™ü•É What is Double Irish & Dutch Sandwich Arrangement?

Double Irish & Dutch Sandwich is a very popular and publicized **arrangement through which mostly US companies were optimizing their taxes from European businesses.** It involved two Irish and one Dutch company. Wikipedia has a nice article on both [Double Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement){:target=" _blank"} and [Dutch Sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Sandwich){:target=" _blank"}, explaining how it works.  In Alphabet/Google case. Companies involved in Double Irish with Dutch Sandwich arrangement are assumed to be:
- **Google Ireland Holding Unlimited** (Irish company with Bermuda domicile) 
- **Google Netherlands Holdings B.V.** (Dutch "sandwich" company that serves as an intermediary between two Ireland companies)
- **Google Ireland Limited** (Ireland company that is directly booking revenue from European business, and sends most of the revenue to the Netherlands as royalties for leasing Google's intellectual property.


## üìÉ List of All Other Alphabet Inc. Direct or Indirect Subsidiaries: 296 Companies
Here is a list of all other companies that I identified as part of Alphabet Inc subsidiaries and did not mention in any of the lists above. There are 296 companies in this list, and together with the companies I mentioned above, it is in total 377 Alphabet/Google Subsidiaries listed in this article.

**Disclaimer:** *Although I did my best to make this list as complete and correct as possible, there might be companies that are part of Alphabet and are not mentioned in the list (or vice versa).  There also might be some errors in the list and the relationship between the companies.  A mistake could happen, for example, when acquisition happened, but Alphabet did not announce it, or the company was liquidated, sold, or moved to other holding companies without making it public (could be the issue with small acquisitions that I still keep in the list). Also, there are companies that I might have just missed.*

**If you think I missed something or know about other companies that should be on the list, please let me know through my Twitter or LinkedIn. I will look into it.**

- [Wikipedia: List of Mergers and Acquisitions by Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet){:target=" _blank"} This is a great consolidated, continually updated list of more than 200 Google/Alphabet's acquisitions. It helped me a lot with my research, mainly thanks to the list of links to original announcements and news articles.

- [State of Delaware Company Registry:](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx){:target=" _blank"} One has to wonder if the user interface is so user-unfriendly on purpose. Additionally, you can only find for free if the company ever existed. If you want to know if the company is still active, it will cost you $10. 

- [State of California Company Registry:](https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/){:target=" _blank"} Straightforward to use, with online free access also to documents companies are required to submit. However, it includes only companies that do business in California or registered in California. Unfortunately, Google US subsidiaries are mostly registered in Delaware.
